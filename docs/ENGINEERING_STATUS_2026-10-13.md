# SableOS Titan 2 engineering status — 2026-10-13

**Authority:** documentation-only draft; [October 11 hybrid-derived reconciliation contract](titan2/N1F_OCT11_HYBRID_DERIVED_RECONCILIATION_20261013.md).

| Lane | Current state |
|---|---|
| Panther R9 | Previously accepted frozen touch-first reference, unchanged |
| Titan 2 Oct03 N1F | **Operator-selected OFFLINE PLANNING parent only**; previously boot-qualified sealed system image SHA256 `dc1f917d5892afc04c479907913eb27a436d5abd881377d3e24fd1d7eb46299a` |
| Titan 2 Oct11 experiment | Android booted and brief data registration observed; exact flashed image/journal not bound |
| Titan 2 Oct13 M4 | system_a write completed; Android entered recovery; boot FAIL |
| Device after failed reset | Factory reset attempted unsuccessfully, operator returned device to fastbootd; recovery logs unavailable |
| Selected next work | Oct03 parent-source and matched LP/AVB provenance planning matrix; eventual hybrid super remains OFFLINE and requires separate build approval; embedded IMS into system/system_ext, G1/G2/G3 open |
| Device/build/release | NO new source mutation, build, device contact, flash, reboot, reset or production admission |

The [October 3 N1F parent-selection decision](titan2/N1F_OCT03_PARENT_SELECTION_DECISION_20261013.md) is for planning only: it does not select the unbound October 11 super, imply a matched whole-super parent, or authorize any image build, extraction or repack.

Historical research remains available on [closed PR #339](https://github.com/aimindseye/sableos/pull/339); its branch is not the active execution authority. The new draft PR is the governing engineering review. Public repositories must remain fail-closed; no Titan 2 public flash path is enabled.
