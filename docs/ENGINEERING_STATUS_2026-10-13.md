**Authority:** documentation-only draft; [October 11 hybrid-derived reconciliation contract](titan2/N1F_OCT11_HYBRID_DERIVED_RECONCILIATION_20261013.md).

| Lane | Current state |
|---|---|
| Panther R9 | Previously accepted frozen touch-first reference, unchanged |
| Titan 2 Oct03 N1F | Physically booted, exact sealed image retained as independent fallback |
| Titan 2 Oct11 experiment | Android booted and brief data registration observed; exact flashed image/journal not bound |
| Titan 2 Oct13 M4 | system_a write completed; Android entered recovery; boot FAIL |
| Device after failed reset | Factory reset attempted unsuccessfully, operator returned device to fastbootd; recovery logs unavailable |
| Selected next work | Host-only evidence reconciliation; offline derived hybrid-super design; embedded IMS into system/system_ext; G1/G2/G3 open |
| Device/build/release | NO new source mutation, build, device contact, flash, reboot, reset or production admission |

Historical research remains available on [closed PR #339](https://github.com/aimindseye/sableos/pull/339); its branch is not the active execution authority. The new draft PR is the governing engineering review. Public repositories must remain fail-closed; no Titan 2 public flash path is enabled.
